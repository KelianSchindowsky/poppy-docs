# Assembly guide for Poppy ErgoJr

## Introduction


The Poppy Ergo Jr robot is a small and low cost 6-degree-of-freedom robot arm.
It consists of very simple forms to be able to print in 3D as easily as possible.
The engines have the same functionality as other Poppy  creatures but are slightly less powerful and less precise. The advantage being that are also less expensive.
The electronic card is not integrated, everything is visible, which is very advantageous to manipulate and change.
Its end can be easily modified (At the end of his arm, you can choose among several ends: a lamp, a hand gripper, ...) thanks to OLLO  rivets that are very simple to remove. These rivets can be removed and added very quickly with the OLLO tool, which allows great design freedom.
The software used for other creatures Poppy are the same as for the Poppy ergo, and also has a simulator.

## Mechanical Assembly

### General advices

* You can assemble all the rivets before the construction, it will be easier after.
* You have to put the edges of the first part in the second part holes. This will then be able to remove them.

![OLLO Rivet Assembly](../img/ollo_rivet.png)

After, use the OLLO Tool for the rivets, it's really convenient. This tool allows to put and remove the rivets easily.

![OLLO Tool](../img/assembly/ollo-tool.jpg)

* Do not forget to put wires between motors while building the robot! Each motor, except the last, must have two wires; one connected to the previous motor and the other to the next (no favorite side).
* If you want, there are slots for getting the most beautifully wires and avoid damaging them.

* Always align the horn with the motor before assembling them! Otherwise your Poppy Ergo Jr will look all weird.

### Step 1

Connect the longest cable to one XL-320 motor. Connect a regular cable to the other side.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-1-1.jpg)

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-1-2.jpg)

### Step 2

Mount the motor on the 3D printed base. The wires should go out from the back.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-2.jpg)

### Step 3

Mount the U_horn_to_horn part.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-3-1.jpg)

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-3-2.jpg)

### Step 4

Mount another motor on top.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-4-1.jpg)

The OLLO Pulley is inside and you should assemble it with the bigger rivet. Bonus, you can watch this step in [slow motion](https://vimeo.com/125704291).

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-4-2.jpg)

Do not forget the cable!


### Step 5

Mount both shift_one_sides on the motors.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-5.jpg)

### Step 6

Add another motor on top. Make sure to have the pulley on the same side.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-6.jpg)

### Step 7

Mount the U_side_to_horn on a new motor.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-7.jpg)

### Step 8

Mount it on top of the previous assembly. The nose of the motor should be on the other side of the base.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-8.jpg)

### Step 9

Mount two other shift_one_sides and a motor. Repeat this twice. All the pulley should still be on the same side.

![Another Step](../img/assembly/step-9.jpg)

### Step 10

Always with the OLLO rivets, you can add the end of your choice (you can choose among several ends: a lamp, a hand gripper, ...)

### Step 11

#### Electronics

A small bit of electronic hacking is required for now. You need to power the Xl320 motors with 7.5V.

The cables between motors have two purposes:
- distribute alimentation to each motor
- convey messages to each motor (ordering them to move or asking them for sensors' values)

Thus the alimentation should be added between the USB2Dynamixel (that deals with communication aspects) and the motors. To this end simply create the following hack.

![Power Board](../img/electronic/power-board-xl320.png)

Then connect the USB2Dynamixel on one end and the first motor on the other end. Connect the USB2Dynamixel to your computer or Raspberry Pi. And power the board with 7.5V.

The communication with the motor is TTL, thus configure the USB2Dynamixel in TTL mode as show below.

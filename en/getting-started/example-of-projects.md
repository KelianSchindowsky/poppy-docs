## Overview of projects developed by the community

The Poppy community gathers an interdisciplinary community of beginners and experts 


### School of Moon


### Cherry Project


### Connect Poppy and Arduino thanks to Snap4Arduino

[Gilles](https://forum.poppy-project.org/users/gilles_lassus/), teacher and maker at night, has developed many projects based on the Poppy Ergo Jr and Arduino. For connecting both worlds, it uses [Snap4arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap/). Then, it becomes really easy and elegant to make them communicate. You can simply mix Arduino with Poppy blocks and tadam you can control your robot with any Arduino based sensor.

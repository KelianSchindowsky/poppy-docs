# Install Poppy softwares
You may want to install Poppy softwares only if you are in one of these situation:
1. You want to control a simulated robot
2. [Advanced users] You want to install yourself the operating system of your robot instead of using a [premade ISO image](../installing-images/README.md)
3. [Advanced users] You want to control a Poppy creature from your computer WITHOUT using the Raspberry Pi board.

**Note: The first situation is a "normal case" but the second and third are special usages affordable only by advanced users who have a good comprehension of the global system.**

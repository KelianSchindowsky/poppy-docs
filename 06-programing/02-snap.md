## Using Snap!
Snap! is a blocks-based graphical programming language that allows users to create interactive animations, games, and more, while learning about mathematical and computational ideas. 
Snap! was inspired by Scratch, but also targets both novice and more advanced users by including and expanding Scratch's features.
Snap! is entirely browser made, you can use it from the [official website](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html) but you can also use a [copy of the website](https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/archive/v4.0.2.zip) in your personal computer and open the snap.html file in your browser.
**Note: Even if Snap! use JavaScript and HTML5 which are browser independent technologies, opening blocks for Poppy robots in Snap! is far faster in a web browser based on Webkit engine. We strongly recommend you to use [Chromium Browser](http://chromium.woolyss.com/)(which is very similar to Chrome without tracking tools), or Google Chrome.**

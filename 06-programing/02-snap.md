## Using Snap!
Snap! is a blocks-based graphical programming language that allows users to create interactive animations, games, and more, while learning about mathematical and computational ideas. 
Snap! was inspired by Scratch, but also targets both novice and more advanced users by including and expanding Scratch's features.
Snap! is entirely browser made, you can use it from the [official website](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html) but you can also use a [copy of the website](https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/archive/v4.0.2.zip) in your personnal computer and open the snap.html file in your browser.
**Note: Even if Snap! use JavaScript and HTML5 which are browser independant technologies, open blocks for Poppy robots is far faster in a browser based on Webkit. We strongly recommand you to use Chromium Browser, or Google Chrome.**
